# 1、字典
---
name: "testname"
result: "success"

# 2、列表
# 比如["a","b","c"]
---
- "a"
- "b"
- "c"


# 3、字典嵌套字典{"person1":{"name":"xi","age":"12"},"person2":{"name":"zhang","age":"23"}
---
person1:
 name: xi
 age: 12
person2:
 name: zhang
 age: 23
# 或者
---
 person1:
   name:
     xi
   age:
     12
 person2:
   name:
     zhang
   age:
     23


# 4、字典嵌套列表{"person1":["name","xi","age","12"],"person2":["name","zhang","age","23"]}
---
 person1:
   - name
   - xi
   - age
   - 12
 person2:
   - name
   - zhang
   - age
   - 23


# 5、列表嵌套字典["{"person1":"xi"}",{"age":"12"}]
---
 - person1:
     xi
 - age:
     12


# 6、列表嵌套列表[["person1","xi","zhang"],["age","12","23"]]
---
-
  - person1
  - xi
  - zhang
-
  - age
  - 12
  - 23


# 7、读取多个文档
---
"用户名称1": "test123"
"密码": "123456"
---
"用户名称2": "test456"
"密码": "456789"
